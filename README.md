# Unhandled File Errors in Go Program

This repository demonstrates a common error in Go programs: the lack of proper error handling. The `bug.go` file contains a program that attempts file operations without checking for errors.  This can lead to silent failures and unexpected program behavior.

The `bugSolution.go` file provides a corrected version of the program that demonstrates best practices for error handling.

**Problem:** The original program fails gracefully when it encounters errors during file operations. This makes debugging difficult.

**Solution:**  The solution involves explicitly checking the return values of functions that might return errors and handling these errors appropriately (e.g., logging, returning errors, or taking corrective action).
